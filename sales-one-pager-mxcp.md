# RAW Labs MXCP: Real-Time Data for Squirro's Enhanced RAG

**Classification**: Partner Confidential

## 1. The Gap We Fill

**SquirroChat excels at documents. But what about live operational data?**

Enterprise AI needs both:
- ✓ Documents & knowledge (Squirro's strength)
- ✗ Real-time ERP, CRM, trading platforms, and internal applications (the gap)

**RAW Labs MXCP bridges this gap with secure, audited access to live business systems.**

> 💡 **The Evolution**: You might know RAW Labs as "data virtualization" - but we're now SO much more. We're the first production-grade MCP server (the "USB for AI" as everyone calls it), connecting Squirro to ANY business system.

## 2. How It Works

```
1. User asks SquirroChat about data in SAP, Salesforce, or trading systems
2. Squirro Agent invokes typed MXCP tool with parameters
3. MXCP queries the live business application with security policies applied
4. Response returned with full audit trail
```

### 2.1 What Makes This Exciting for Customers
- **Instant answers**: Ask about SAP inventory, get answers in 3 seconds
- **Bank-grade security**: Every query authenticated, authorized, and audited
- **Zero data duplication**: Sensitive data stays where it belongs
- **Natural language**: "Show me overdue invoices" instead of complex SQL

### 2.2 When to Use MXCP

| Ingestion (Standard) | Virtualization (MXCP) |
|---------------------|----------------------|
| Document search | Live operational queries |
| 30-60 min freshness OK | Sub-minute freshness required |
